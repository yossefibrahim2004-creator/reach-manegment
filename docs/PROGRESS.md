## Log

### 2026-10-01 — Phase 0: Scaffold ✅
**Built**
- Next.js 16.3.8 static export (`output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash`, `images.unoptimized`, `basePath` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`), TS strict, Tailwind v4 with DESIGN.md tokens in `@theme`, Prettier + ESLint (`no-explicit-any` = error).
- next-intl 4.14.8 without middleware: `src/lib/i18n/{routing,request,navigation}.ts`, locale via `next/root-params`, `ar` default, `localePrefix: 'always'`, `generateStaticParams`.
- Three root layouts: `(site)/[locale]` (lang/dir per locale + `NextIntlClientProvider`), `(admin)` (Arabic RTL, noindex), `(redirect)` (static `/` → `/ar/` meta-refresh + JS fallback, basePath-aware).
- Bilingual 404 via `app/global-not-found.tsx` (`experimental.globalNotFound`) → `out/404.html`.
- Fonts via `next/font/google`: Cairo / Inter / JetBrains Mono (`src/lib/fonts.ts`), per-locale family selection in CSS.
- `.env.example`, README skeleton, `scripts/serve.mjs` (static server emulating GitHub Pages), `public/.nojekyll`, minimal AR/EN messages + placeholder pages.

**Verified** (commands + results)
- `npm run build` → OK, routes `/`, `/[locale]` (ar, en), `/admin`, `/_not-found`; all static (○/●), experiment `globalNotFound` enabled. `out/` contains `index.html`, `ar/`, `en/`, `admin/`, `404.html`, `.nojekyll`.
- `npm run lint` → 0 problems (probe file with `any` correctly fails, removed after).
- `npm run typecheck` (`next typegen && tsc --noEmit`, from a clean `.next/`) → 0 errors.
- `npm run format:check` → all files conform.
- Served `out/` with `scripts/serve.mjs`: `/` 200 `lang=ar dir=rtl` + `http-equiv refresh → /ar/`; `/ar/` 200 rtl + Arabic content; `/en/` 200 ltr + English content; `/admin/` 200 rtl + `noindex`; unknown path → HTTP 404 with bilingual `404.html`.
- Rebuilt with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/reach-site` and served from a `/reach-site/` prefix: refresh URL, asset URLs, nav links and 404 home link all prefixed; same 200/404 + lang/dir results.

**Decisions**: D-011, D-012, D-013 resolved; D-014…D-021 added (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Open questions**: none blocking. D-006 (Appendix A ⚠ rows) and D-008 (category icons) remain open for later phases.

### 2026-10-01 — Phase 1: Supabase ✅
**Built**
- `supabase/` project (CLI 2.119.0 as devDependency): `config.toml` with ports remapped to 560xx (D-022), `seed.sql` path wired.
- Four migrations in order: `0001_functions` (`public.is_admin()` from spec §5 verbatim + `set_updated_at()`), `0002_schema` (all 11 tables from §5 with AR/EN column pairs, check constraints, indexes on category/brand/series/is_published/product_images + GIN on `specs`, `updated_at` trigger), `0003_rls` (RLS on 11 tables → 29 policies: public read of published/active rows, admin-only writes, drafts hidden), `0004_storage` (buckets `product-images` webp ≤5 MB, `catalogs` pdf ≤10 MB, `site-assets` ≤5 MB, public read / admin write policies on `storage.objects`).
- `supabase/seed.sql` — 17 categories, 8 brands, 7 spec definitions, 65 products (Appendix A) all `is_published = false`; availability per D-004; re-runnable (`on conflict do nothing`).
- `supabase/tests/rls_verify.sql` — DoD suite: seed counts, RLS/policy inventory, anon read/write matrix on all 11 tables + storage, `is_active`/`is_published` filtering, authenticated-no-admin denial, full admin round-trip, `updated_at` trigger, cleanup to pristine state.
- `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` generated (`gen types typescript --local --schema public`), added to `.prettierignore`.
- README: Supabase section (migration table, local dev, RLS test command, type regeneration, hosted setup incl. disable-signups + admin user + `app_metadata.role='admin'` SQL from current Supabase docs).

**Verified** (commands + results)
- Local stack: `npx supabase start` (postgres-only exclude variant; full stack not needed this phase) → `Started supabase local development setup` on ports 560xx.
- `npx supabase db reset` → all 4 migrations + seed applied, exit 0 (run twice — idempotence re-checked).
- `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 … < supabase/tests/rls_verify.sql` → **`ALL RLS CHECKS PASSED`**, 0 failures: anon blocked on INSERT (11 tables + storage), 0-row on UPDATE/DELETE (11 + storage), drafts invisible (0 of 65), published/unpublished transitions correct, non-admin authenticated denied, admin full CRUD + storage allowed, all fixtures restored (17/8/7/65 final counts).
- Types file: 311 lines, UTF-8 without BOM, contains all 11 tables + `is_admin`/`set_updated_at`.
- `npm run build` / `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run format:check` → all pass (re-run at phase end).

**Environment notes (for future sessions)**
- C: drive was at 0 GB free → Docker's WSL disk went read-only mid-pull; freed space (npm cache 5.4 GB + temp) and restarted Docker. Watch disk before pulling the full stack (Studio etc. ≈ several GB) — Phase 2+ needs `kong`/`postgrest` at minimum for supabase-js.
- `config.toml` ports are 560xx (D-022). Local DB URL: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:56022/postgres`.
- psql on this machine ignores options placed **after** the connection string — always put `-v`/`-f` first; PowerShell lacks `<` redirect.

**Decisions**: D-022…D-027 added (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Open questions**: D-006 (⚠ rows 46/65 need owner confirmation), D-005 (placeholder contact/certificate data — Phase 2 will need at least contact numbers; who seeds them: admin UI in Phase 4 or SQL placeholder in Phase 2?).

### 2026-10-01 — Phase 2: Public site —

**Built**
- Layout & chrome: `(site)/[locale]/layout.tsx` (skip link, header, footer, floating WhatsApp), `site-header` (topbar hours+phone, nav, language switch preserving query, mobile menu), `site-footer` (phones, socials, nav, legal), `floating-whatsapp`.
- Data layer: `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (server-only build-time client) + `src/lib/supabase/queries.ts` (typed, `cache()`-wrapped queries per D-029).
- Pages: Home (hero with `*highlight*` parsing + decorative panel, categories, featured, brands, why-us, certificates/projects conditionals, CTA), Products listing, Product detail (breadcrumbs, gallery+lightbox, chips, labelled spec table, catalog AR/EN fallback, WhatsApp quote, related), About, Contact, per-locale `not-found`.
- Products explorer: debounced search (MiniSearch + `normalizeArabic()`, D-031), facet filters (category/brand/system/availability + spec groups for a single category), chips, sort (D-037), sticky sidebar / mobile drawer, 24-per-page load-more, empty state with WhatsApp CTA, URL state per D-030.
- Components: `product-card` (cover/glyph, availability badge, 3-value spec line per D-038), `category-tile`, `breadcrumbs`, `section-heading`, `lightbox`, `hero-panel`, `certificates-grid`, quote button, 17-slug icon map (D-032), `waLink`/`telLink` helpers, `splitHighlight`.
- Full AR/EN copy: `src/messages/{ar,en}.json` (meta, nav, common, availability, system, home, products, product, about, contact, footer, notFound).
- Seed additions (D-033): placeholder contact numbers, social links, site texts; all 65 products published locally (D-034); RLS suite made publish-state-agnostic.

**Verified** (commands + results)
- `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors. `npm run lint` — 0 problems (fixed 3× `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` with render-adjustment/close-on-click patterns, 3× `react-hooks/static-components` with `categoryGlyph()`). `npm run format` — clean.
- `npm run build` — OK: 143 static pages (ar+en for all pages, 130 product pages = 65 slugs × 2 locales), `globalNotFound` intact.
- `npm run serve` (port 4173): `/ar/`, `/en/`, `/ar/products/`, `/ar/products/hst-mcp`, `/ar/about/`, `/ar/contact/`, `/en/products/` → 200; unknown path → HTTP 404; `/ar/products/?q=panel&sort=name_asc&category=control-panels` → 200.
- HTML checks: AR `lang=ar dir=rtl`, EN `dir=ltr`; hero marker fully parsed; `wa.me` links present; phones carry `dir="ltr"` (header, footer, contact); hero panel `aria-hidden`; spec table renders when specs exist (`hst-economy-4-zone-panel` → `{"zones":4}`) and is omitted when `{}` (`hst-mcp`); home renders featured cards + product links; certificates/projects sections hidden while tables are empty (0 rows — no invented data); products listing prerender = skeleton (D-030), explorer present in client chunks.
- DB after publish: 65 published / 8 featured / 17 categories / 17 settings / 2 phones / 3 socials / 7 spec defs / 8 brands / 0 certificates / 0 projects.
- `supabase/tests/rls_verify.sql` → `ALL RLS CHECKS PASSED` after the publish update, fixture counts restored (D-034).

**Decisions**: D-028…D-039 added; D-008 resolved (see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Open questions**: D-006 (⚠ rows 46/65 need owner confirmation) and D-005 (phone numbers remain placeholders; certificates/projects stay hidden until real rows exist). Social-link seed placeholders were removed in the 2026-10-05 follow-up; verified public profiles and the RECH handle mismatch still need owner confirmation.

### 2026-10-02 — Phase 2 re-verification + local port move ✅
- Windows `netsh` exclusion ranges shifted again: 553xx became forbidden, so the local stack moved to **560xx** (`supabase/config.toml`, `.env.local`, README, this file, D-022). Docker Desktop was restarted from scratch; `npx supabase start` green on the new ports, legacy anon key still accepted by REST.
- `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` / `npm run format` (one file re-formatted) → 0 errors; `npm run build` → 143 static pages, all routes SSG/static.
- `npm run serve` route matrix re-run: `/ar/`+`/en/` (lang/dir correct), products listing/detail (both locales), about, contact, admin (noindex), query-string listing URL → 200; unknown path → HTTP 404; `wa.me` + `dir="ltr"` phones present; hero marker parsed; spec table present on `hst-economy-4-zone-panel`, absent on `hst-mcp`; certificates/projects sections hidden (0 rows).
- `psql -f supabase/tests/rls_verify.sql` → **ALL RLS CHECKS PASSED**, fixtures restored (17/8/7/65, 2 phones, 3 socials, 17 settings, 0 images/certificates/projects).
- Secret scan: no `service_role`/tokens in tracked files; `.env.local` git-ignored.

### 2026-10-03 — Audit pass: responsive + WCAG ✅
**Built**
- `src/lib/use-dialog.ts` — shared focus-in / Tab-trap / scroll-lock / focus-restore hook (D-042), used by `products-explorer` (filter drawer) and `lightbox`.
- Fixes: `grid-cols-1` on 18 grids (D-040), global focus outline + `::placeholder` (D-041), absolutely positioned mobile menu + outside-click close (D-045), 44px controls / ≥24px inline links (D-043), 16px fields (D-044), specs table `overflow-x-auto`, safe-area insets on floating WhatsApp + toast, `rtl:origin-right` on the product-card accent bar, lightbox `85dvh` + RTL arrow keys.
- Also fixed a pre-existing lint error in `site-header` (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` → render-phase adjustment, same pattern as the explorer).

**Verified** (Chrome headless CDP against the static `out/` build, no npm deps added)
- `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build` → all green; 146 static pages.
- Viewport matrix 8 pages × 320/375/414/768/1024/1280 (48 combos): **0 horizontal scroll, 0 layout errors, 0 undersized inputs**; 46/48 fully clean, the 2 remaining only flag the 16px checkbox *inside* its 32px label (D-043).
- Before → after at 320px: `/ar/` scrollWidth 369 → 320, `/en/` 323 → 320.
- Interaction tests: mobile menu open no longer shifts content (mainTop 121 → 121, was 116 → 350); filter drawer focuses its close button, locks body scroll, keeps Tab inside, restores focus; focus ring computed as `2px solid rgb(215,38,30)` with no radius override.
- Lightbox verified through a temporary static harness page (removed afterwards, `out/` rebuilt clean): focus-in, scroll lock, Escape close, focus restore, and **RTL arrow mirroring** (AR: ArrowRight → previous; EN: ArrowRight → next).

**Not verified**: the authenticated admin UI (no session in the test harness) — code-reviewed only; certificates/projects galleries unreachable because those tables are empty (no invented data, D-005).

**Decisions**: D-040–D-045 added. **Open questions**: D-043 strict-44px?, plus two pre-existing files failing `format:check` that were left untouched: `src/app/(site)/[locale]/layout.tsx`, `start.md`.

### 2026-10-05 — Phase 2 public conversion follow-up (verification blocked)
**Built**
- Added the bilingual `/[locale]/contractors/` landing page, linked from the main navigation and prominent home-page CTAs. The request form validates client-side with the existing Zod dependency, opens WhatsApp with all fields and a source tag, and states that drawings must be attached manually (the static site has no lead-submission endpoint).
- Added catalog downloads only for published products with catalog URLs; no empty downloads section is shown.
- Hid categories with zero published products on the home page and in filters; corrected Arabic category labels without changing slugs. Removed generic Chinese-origin data from brand presentation, centralized display spellings, and added migration updates for existing data.
- Replaced installation-adjacent/unsupported copy with supply-only messaging, removed placeholder About text and fake seeded social links, and strip `fbclid` when rendering links. The header shows every active contact number and picks a marked WhatsApp destination randomly per click.

**Verified**
- `npm run lint` → 0 problems; `npm run typecheck` → 0 errors; Prettier check on touched application files → clean.
- Arabic/English public message keys → 173 each, no missing keys.
- `next build` compiled and passed TypeScript, but failed while collecting product route data because `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points to the stopped local service at `127.0.0.1:56021`. `npx supabase start` could not start because Docker Desktop's Linux engine is unavailable. The new database migration is therefore not yet applied or locally validated, and no new production export/browser layout test was produced.
- No `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists in this checkout; deployment automation remains outside this phase.

**Open follow-ups**
- Start Docker/Supabase, apply and verify the new migration, then rerun the production build and AR/EN RTL/LTR viewport checks before marking this follow-up verified.
- Bases, batteries and cables are essential to a complete BOQ; add verified products for any of these categories that remain empty. Do not invent catalog entries.
- Confirm Snower's official Arabic spelling and which (if either) RECH social handle is official. Certificate, project/client, and verified social-profile data remain absent/owner-provided only.
- SEO work (sitemap, robots, hreflang, Open Graph and structured data) is deferred to Phase 6 per the approved phase gate.

**Decisions**: D-046–D-050 added. Phase 3 has not started.

### 2026-10-06 — Phase 2 public header contact details
**Built**
- The top strip labels every active phone number in the selected language.
- Expanded the seeded working-hours text to explicitly say Saturday through Thursday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. A migration updates only the unchanged original placeholder pair, leaving owner-customized hours intact.
- Replaced the seeded placeholder phone numbers with the owner-provided sales/WhatsApp and technical-support numbers. The new migration updates only the two original placeholder numbers in existing databases.

**Verification**
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and Prettier checks on the changed TypeScript/docs passed.
- `npm run build` compiled and passed TypeScript, but failed while collecting product pages because the configured local Supabase endpoint is unavailable. The hours and contact-number migrations were not applied or database-validated.

**Decisions**: D-051–D-052 added. Phone-number role mapping follows the existing seed order (sales/WhatsApp first, technical support second).
